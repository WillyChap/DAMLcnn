The most important thing to do when setting up forpy_mod is to follow this post: [CGD post](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/threads/compiler-flags.7980/)

What needs to be done is an adjustment to: 

CESMcaseROOT/cime/config/cesm/machines/config_compilers.xml

in the LDL flags. the config_compilers.xml file will contain that information.
